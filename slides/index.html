							- I love software, you can make all kinds of things (art, products, tools)
							- It’s constrained to the digital, hard to make things feel tangible online or interact with the real world
							- Something about physical objects seem more substantial (books, tools, art)
							- Need a hobby that doesn’t involve sitting in front of the computer

							- Started seeing more hardware online
							- Community of hardware enthusiasts interested in aesthetics not just functionality.
							- Many people getting into product design through 3D printing
							- Product design and industrial design are huge fields

						Skill: Electronics
						<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
							- To tap into this world of circuits and components you’ll need to understand the interactions and relationships between voltage, current and resistance.
							- There are lots of analogies to existing physical phenomena (water, air, chains/pulleys) but they’re never perfect.

						<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
							- Basic building blocks of any circuit are components, you've heard of resistors, capacitors and transistors
							- Also will be building using Integrated Circuits (ICs)
							- - In software you *could* write all the functionality from scratch, but more complex and more likely to get something wrong
							- Same thing in electronics. Many Integrated Circuits (ICs) exist that perform complex or common tasks in a neat package.
							- charging a battery cell, converting from one protocol to another or complex sensors.
							- Microcontroller = IC = mini computer

						<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
							- Making a LED matrix means we need LEDs, a LED driver and a microcontroller
							- Power input and probably some passive components
							- Resistors can reduce the voltage to a component or provide a connection to power or ground resulting in a consistent input to a component.
							- Capacitors absorb spikes in voltage and provide a easy supply of current when needed by a component

							- Could use modules or breakout boards
							- Would require no soldering or figuring out supporting components
